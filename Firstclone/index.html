                <li><h3>Commenting</h3></li>
                <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often 
                 ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create.
                 With proper comments and organised files its always 
                 easier for you or others to jump in and understand where things
                  are at and how they work.

                <li><h3>Learning Command Line Is The Way To Go.</h3></li>
                <p>
                    It is a standard convention among developers to use GUI tools to power the terminal. What most of them don’t realize is that by doing so, they end up spending a significant portion of their valuable time in handling GUI tools than making progress on the terminal. The right way to go about it is learning the command line. Start with the basics of the command line and advance to higher levels as you go, and you’ll find that you can complete several tasks with much more ease and efficiency with command line tools than with GUI tools. Moreover, automating the terminal with appropriate commands is a great way to save time and energy. 
                </p>
                <li><h3>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h3></li>
                <p>
                    By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.
